                                project enablers face when it comes to tracking project activities,
                                verifying their completion and thereafter safely storing the data records to

                                <p>This challenge exists mainly because the implementation strategies of such
                                    projects are mostly manual and involve little to no digitization. This large
                                    reliance on manual labor and lack of digitization means that the project
                                    enablers have to often rely on manually generated feedback reports and “word
                                    of mouth” when it comes to verifying the completion of project tasks. These
                                    factors result in a potential wast eof resources for the organizations because
                                    they are unable to effectively monitor and evaluate the performance of their
                                    projects due to the lack of timely, reliable and objective feed-back data.</p>

                                    With this objecctive, AMDT therefore simultaneously conducts various
                                    development projects throughout Tanzania ranging from beneficiary
                                    workshops to equipment supplying. These projects each involve multiple
                                    facilitators and actors along the way where data flow plays a crucial role
                                    in the effeciency and completion of each porject.

                                    manual processes, and the company has now adopted and implements
                                    RADARMILE in all of their projects therefore automating many of their
                                    project implementation processes.
